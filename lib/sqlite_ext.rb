    # Registers a Ruby `Proc` to be used as a function in SQL
    # code executed through subsequent new instances of
    # `SQLite3::Database`.
    #
    # When `NULL` value is passed 1 or more of the `Proc`'s
    # required parameters, it will be "propagated", meaning that
    # the specified `Proc` will not be invoked and `NULL` will be
    # returned from the call in SQL.
    #
    # When non-`NULL` values are passed to all of the `Proc`'s
    # required parameters and `NULL` is passed to any or all of
    # the `Proc`'s optional parameters, they will NOT be
    # propagated, and the `Proc` WILL be invoked. Values passed
    # as `NULL` in SQL will be forwarded to the `Proc` as Ruby
    # `nil`s.
    #
    # Whenever the `Proc` is called and returns `nil`, that will
    # result in `NULL` being returned from the function call in
    # SQL.
    #
    # Example:
    #
    # SqliteExt.register_function(
    #   'sqrt',
    #   ->(x){ Math.sqrt(x) }
    # )
    #
    # SQLite3::Database.new 'data.db' do |db|
    #   puts db.execute(
    #     "SELECT sqrt(25), COALESCE(sqrt(NULL), -1)"
    #   ).first
    # end
    #
    # # == Output ==
    # # 5.0
    # # -1
